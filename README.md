# Build Google Sheets Data Entry Form With DronaHQ’s Form Builder
Google Sheets is a popularly used tool by businesses for regular data capture and analysis. Features like charts, pivot tables, what-if analysis, conditional formatting, sorts, and filters make Google sheets a very useful tool for business users.

One of the greatest strengths of Google Sheets lies in its ability to integrate with other apps. For example, businesses can easily integrate Sheets with tools like Asana, Google Analytics, Dropbox, HubSpot, etc. to create an efficient internal workflow. With Google Sheets,  business users can collate datasets from these apps to ensure their availability and visibility for internal collaboration, edits, and analysis.

An integral part of Google Sheets and its primary data collection tool is Forms. Forms collect datasets and seamlessly integrate these datasets with Google Sheets to assist business leaders with a data-backed decision-making process. 

You can easily create a form with form builders like DronaHQ. In this article, we will take you through the key features of a DronaHQ’s [form builder](https://www.dronahq.com/form-builder/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=googlesheets&utm_campaign=smit) and assist you to build one for yourself.
